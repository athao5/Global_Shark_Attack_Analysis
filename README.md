# Shark Attack Analysis (2014 - 2023): 
## Analyzing Trends, Locations, and Attack Types

### Introduction:

The problem involves gaining better insights into shark attack patterns, with a focus on timing, demographics, species involved, and injuries. Understanding these factors can enhance safety measures, improve emergency response systems, and contribute to marine conservation efforts. The objective is to identify high-risk situations, inform the public, and support strategies to prevent harmful shark-human interactions.

### Data/Operation Abstraction Design:

The data was retrieved from the Opendatasoft website. The data was cleaned using data interpreter and pre-processed to ensure consistency and accuracy. This involved removing duplicates, addressing missing values, and standardizing fields such as dates and categorical variables (e.g., species, location, activity). The dataset was then loaded into Tableau for visualization, with fields created to categorize attack types, time of day, and fatal vs. non-fatal incidents. The data was grouped and filtered to facilitate the analysis of trends across key variables, including species, geography, and victim demographics.

### Future Work:

Future improvements include integrating additional data sources, such as ocean temperature, seasonal patterns, and human population density near attack sites, to enhance analysis. Developing predictive models to forecast potential attack hotspots based on historical trends and environmental conditions is another potential enhancement. Adding real-time data on shark movements and interactions could further contribute to public safety and awareness.
